           Hello! My name is Malasia Woods 21 years young software engineer, I was born and raised in San Fransico
           but located to Stockton when I was 17. I play around with HTML, CSS, and Javacript, I chose coding becuse I wanted to change 
           my living situation also wanting a way out of hard labor on the other hand solving problems are fun for me and its 
           perfect stimulation, also coding is a good way to practice your professionalism. I'm a soon to be graduate from Thinkful bootcamp.
           My dream is to become a retail business owner of my own fashion company.
        </p>

           I've created a quiz that people can take to test their knowlwdge about cats. It's made for people that like cats, the way this quiz works is you start the quiz 
           answer the question, submit your question it gives you the correct answer and you click next to render the next question. At the end of quiz it gives you a total score of your right and wrong answers.
