           Hello! My name is Malasia Woods 21 years young software engineer, I was born and raised in San Fransico
but located to Stockton when I was 17. I play around with HTML, CSS, and Javacript, I chose coding becuse I wanted to change 
my living situation also wanting a way out of hard labor on the other hand solving problems are fun for me and its 
perfect stimulation, also coding is a good way to practice your professionalism. I'm a soon to be graduate from Thinkful bootcamp.
My dream is to become a retail business owner of my own fashion company.

and how loving they are also cats don't get a lot of credit.
